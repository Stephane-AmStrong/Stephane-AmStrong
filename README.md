### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm StÃ©phane from Africa, and I do Web and Mobile development. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like C#, Kotlin, Asp.Net, and Android native, as well as working remotely. I also enjoy using IT to improve people's lives in general. You can check out my LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/stÃ©phane-adjakotan-1b041a16b
